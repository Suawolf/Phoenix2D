[1.1]

  *  Now, Phoenix2D is divided in three parts: Phoenix2D-base, in charge of the low level task such as
     send and receive messages, parse information, manage sensors, etc, Phoenix2D-libs, in charge of the
     artificial intelligent of the player, and the main.cpp file in charge of launching the program.  
     Both Phoenix2D-base and Phoenix2D-libs are compiled as static libraries, the first as stand-alone and 
     the second as dependent of Phoenix2D-base.

  *  Added python script for trainer scripting.  The class is provided in the Controller.py file and a
     example of use is provided in he trainer.py file.  This is a basic scripting and only can use the
     methods changeTo(<PLAY_MODE>) and recover().

  *  Added PFilter class for a basic particle filter implementation.  For the moment this class is used
     and optimized for the localization task.
